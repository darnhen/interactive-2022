            <br>Hi Riley Moran,
    
    <br><br>How are you? 
    
    <br<br>I’m writing with two asks:
    
    <br><br> One: To continue this email chain. We haven’t talked much in recent years 
    and I don’t like that!<sup><a href="#one-m-s" id="ref-one-m-s">1</a></sup> Email for me offers languid, lengthy replies (like snail mail) 
    but has a quicker receive date (thanks technology!). Whatever you choose, is fine (obviously).

    <br><br> Two: For my Software for People course (coding class), we have to interview someone 
    we know of but do not know personally. The first idea that struck me, and stuck with me, is 
    asking people I love to forward the email of someone they love to interview. It can be anyone 
    so as long as I don’t know them. Of course, if you don’t want to or can’t think of anyone, it 
    is no problem! The assignment post interview is to then code that interview. Anyways.. Happy 
    New Year! Looking forward to your reply!
    
    <br><br> Wishing You Might, & All Things Bright,
    <br>Darnell Henderson

            <sup> <a href="#ref-one-m-s" id="one-m-s">1</a> </sup> Riley and I have known each other since middle school.
            My first memory of her is her saying: Let's go fishing for cabbages. We were on a service trip in middle school 
            and I don't exactly remember why we we were working with cabbages, but there was nonetheless a giant box of them that
            we leaned on one side to grab.

            <br>Hi sweet Darnell. 
    
    <br><br>Software for People sounds like a class a character in an A24 movie would take. 
    Still I like your project which is kind of the Loves of the Loves of your Life which is 
    very sexy but makes me feel kind of sad (?) 
    
    <br<br>I can think of a few people. Would you prefer someone young or old? For young I 
    give you cullenfagan@gmail.com, who is too smart for her own good despite living in New 
    York instead of New Orleans like some kind of idiot. 

    <br><br>My grandpa would also totally do this but you'd need to do the actual snail mail because 
    he doesn't know how to work email. But he loves to write his little letters and he's funny 
    and old people are always chomping at the bit to be interviewed (as far as I can tell).

    <br><br>I'll warn Cullen that you're emailing in case. 

    <br><br>How are you?<sup><a href="#one-r-s" id="ref-one-r-s">1</a></sup> How is school?<sup><a href="#two-r-s" id="ref-two-r-s">2</a></sup> 
    Are you happy?<sup><a href="#three-r-s" id="ref-three-r-s">3</a></sup> Do you like grad school better than undergrad?<sup><a href="#four-r-s" id="ref-four-r-s">4</a></sup> 
    What's the best class you've taken?<sup><a href="#five-r-s" id="ref-five-r-s">5</a></sup> Do you have crushes? <sup><a href="#six-r-s" id="ref-six-r-s">6</a></sup>

            <sup> <a href="#ref-one-r-s" id="one-r-s">1</a> </sup> Good! Very busy, but I like that.
            <br>
            <sup> <a href="#ref-two-r-s" id="two-r-s">2</a> </sup> Busy!!
            <br>
            <sup> <a href="#ref-three-r-s" id="three-r-s">3</a></sup> Yes.
            <br>
            <sup> <a href="#ref-four-r-s" id="four-r-s">4</a></sup> Academically, grad school. Both are fun, however.
            <br>
            <sup> <a href="#ref-five-r-s" id="five-r-s">5</a></sup> Hm. I liked my motion course last semester but because
            of the subject, not the professor. I am enjoying this coding course I am taking also :)
            <br>
            <sup> <a href="#ref-six-r-s" id="six-r-s">6</a></sup> Yes and no.
