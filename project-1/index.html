        <br>Hi You,

<br><br>How are you? 

<br><br>Welcome to <span id="title">The Love Network</span>. This project utilizes 
email as means for reaching towards those who surround us and give us feelings 
of kindness and warmth.

<br><br> I began this project by emailing a friend of mine 
and asking for the email of someone they loved.

<br><br> I chatted and chatted with this
friend.<sup><a href="#one-m-s" id="ref-one-m-s">1</a></sup>

<br><br>It is my aim with this project to think of love
        as something elastic. Something with the capability to move. To speak
        even in the event of screen to screen contact. Exploring methods that communities
        can be created.

<br><br>Love,
<br>Darnell Henderson

        <br>Hi Riley Moran,

<br><br>How are you? 

<br<br>I’m writing with two asks:

<br><br> One: To continue this email chain. We haven’t talked much in recent years 
and I don’t like that!<sup><a href="#two-one-m-s" id="ref-two-one-m-s">1</a></sup> Email for me offers languid, lengthy replies (like snail mail) 
but has a quicker receive date (thanks technology!). Whatever you choose, is fine (obviously).

<br><br> Two: For my Software for People course (coding class), we have to interview someone 
we know of but do not know personally. The first idea that struck me, and stuck with me, is 
asking people I love to forward the email of someone they love to interview. It can be anyone 
so as long as I don’t know them. Of course, if you don’t want to or can’t think of anyone, it 
is no problem! The assignment post interview is to then code that interview. Anyways.. Happy 
New Year! Looking forward to your reply!

<br><br> Wishing You Might, & All Things Bright,
<br>Darnell Henderson

        <br>Hi sweet Darnell. 

<br><br>Software for People sounds like a class a character in an A24 movie would take. 
Still I like your project which is kind of the Loves of the Loves of your Life which is 
very sexy but makes me feel kind of sad (?) 

<br<br>I can think of a few people. Would you prefer someone young or old? For young I 
give you cullenfagan@gmail.com, who is too smart for her own good despite living in New 
York instead of New Orleans like some kind of idiot. 

<br><br>My grandpa would also totally do this but you'd need to do the actual snail mail because 
he doesn't know how to work email. But he loves to write his little letters and he's funny 
and old people are always chomping at the bit to be interviewed (as far as I can tell).

<br><br>I'll warn Cullen that you're emailing in case. 

<br><br>How are you?<sup><a href="#one-r-s" id="ref-one-r-s">1</a></sup> How is school?<sup><a href="#two-r-s" id="ref-two-r-s">2</a></sup>

        <br>Hi Darnell, 

<br><br>I am happy to be your interview subject - any friend of Riley's is a friend of mine. 
I'm doing well! I hope you are, too. Here are the answers to your questions:

<br<br><br><br>1. My name is Cullen Fagan.
<br><br>2. My pronouns are she/her/hers. 
<br><br>3. My elevator pitch as if I was applying to a job would be - I am a freelance 
marketing specialist and writer, currently contracted in a tech field. 
I have writing and research experience in a legal office, on political campaigns, and 
in an independent news organization. Last year I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University" target=blank> <u>Tulane University</u> </a>, 
where I majored in History and Political Science. I hope to get back to school in the 
next few years - probably law or social work. 
<br><br>4. Something in my daily life that is essential to me is talking to other people<sup><a href="#two-one-r-s" id="ref-two-one-r-s">1</a></sup>. 
I cannot get along very well without human interaction/being alone for long stretches of time, or 
honestly, short stretches of time. Also, reading - I keep my lock screen as a poem that I'm 
into at any given point so if I can't get actual time in to read, I can read that guy.  
<br><br>5. My favorite color is green<sup><a href="#two-two-r-s" id="ref-two-two-r-s">2</a></sup> 
(and also sometimes orange).
<br><br>6. I generally subscribe to the idea that all life is good/valuable (life in and of itself is
 a reason to live, etc), but specifically for me, a good life would mean spending the majority 
 of time with people that I enjoy, eating well, having the freedom to pursue creative endeavors, 
 and doing my best to make other people's lives easier and kinder to them where I can. 
<br><br>7. My elevator pitch if I was introducing myself to a new friend would be - My name is Cullen 
(I usually use Twilight <sup><a href="#two-three-r-s" id="ref-two-three-r-s">3</a></sup>  as a touch point here), I am 22, I am an 
Aries<sup><a href="#aries" id="ref-aries">&#9800;</a></sup>, and the owner of a 2 year old cat named after Frank Costello from 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Departed" target=blank> <u>The Departed</u> </a>. 
I live in Brooklyn, but my very stereotypically Irish Catholic family is from Massachusetts, which is where I grew up. 
I am currently in the fledgling process of starting a pick up croquet league, and am looking for interested parties. 
<br><br>8. The most complicated thing I know is how public defender's need to do investigative/trial prep and processes 
- I worked at the public defender's office when I was in college, and this took me a very, very long time to get 
a good handle on. There were A LOT of moving parts. 

<br><br> I hope this was helpful! Have a nice weekend.

        Though, she goes on to say she cannot spend time alone for very long and this is something I'm very guilty of doing. 
        <br>
        <sup> <a href="#ref-two-two-r-s" id="two-two-r-s">2</a> </sup> I do wear a lot of green. Apparently, it attracts money.

        <br>Hi Cullen,

<br><br>I have to confess— I have some follow up questions.. 

<br<br>Why did you pick a tech company? Could you include one of your work samples or is that, like, illegal?

<br><br> Do you find yourself more attracted to groups of people or one-on-one? I guess that groups of people 
would be a nearly endless source for you? Though, sometimes less intimate.<sup><a href="#four-one-m-s" id="ref-four-one-m-s">1</a></sup>

<br><br> Okay, that is actually such a great practice! Would you mind sending me your current lock screen poem? 
And also what you are reading now? <sup><a href="#four-two-m-s" id="ref-four-two-m-s">2</a></sup>

<br><br> Orange is sometimes my favorite color too! I like yellow the most now though.

<br><br> That is very considerate and gentle way to live. Is there a specific time that you recall where 
you made someone’s life easier or showed them kindness that noticeably affected them? (Is that braggy to 
ask of you to write haha?) Do you cook as hobby?

<br><br> I feel like I should point you in the direction of my family for your croquet team. They play it 
at the beach all the time. Though, that may be wrong.<sup><a href="#four-three-m-s" id="ref-four-three-m-s">3</a></sup> I don’t really know what game they are playing, because 
I don’t ask, but they do look similar.. Do you like New York? <sup><a href="#four-four-m-s" id="ref-four-four-m-s">4</a></sup> What is one emotion that categorizes how you feel 
about Brooklyn?

<br><br> Oh wow! Did you enjoy working at the public defender’s office? Did this experience influence 
your desire to go back to school for law/social work?

        <sup> <a href="#ref-four-one-m-s" id="four-one-m-s">1</a> </sup> I definitely prefer one-on-one. I even think that 
        sometimes three people interactions can begin to depart from intimacy. One person is always going to talk less. 
        Not know what's going on, have less history with one or the other. 
        <br>
        <sup> <a href="#ref-four-two-m-s" id="four-two-m-s">2</a> </sup> A few of my friends have the same practice. Wondering if I should
        follow along.. I'm not reading anything right now. I was reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sailor_Who_Fell_from_Grace_with_the_Sea" target="blank"> <u>The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea by Yukio Mishima</u></a>, 
        but I wasted too much time not reading it and had to return it to the library. Should check it out again...

        <sup> <a href="#ref-four-three-m-s" id="four-three-m-s">3</a> </sup> This actually was wrong. My family plays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocce" target="blank"> <u>bocce</u></a>.

    <div id="two-r-cullen" class="reply-message">
        <br>Hi Darnell, 

<br><br>No worries -

<br<br><br><br>1. I chose a tech company because it was the most well paid position I was 
offered when job searching, and I am interested in being able to afford to go to graduate school. 
The work itself seemed relatively morally neutral, and that felt like an okay trade off for me in the short term. 
I unfortunately cannot share a writing sample with you, because while it is not illegal, it is directly against my contract. Sorry!

<br><br>2. I think small groups are my ideal situation. I don't love crowds, but too much one on one time with a single person 
inevitably leaves me vaguely irritated with them. 

<br><br>3. <a href="https://lithub.com/if-i-should-come-upon-your-house-lonely-in-the-west-texas-desert/" target="blank"> <u>This 
poem</u> </a> is my current lock screen. I am currently alternating between <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36348525-severance" 
target="blank"><u>Severance by Ling Ma</u></a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43352954-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war" target="blank"><u>How You Lose the Time War 
by Max Gladstone</u></a>, neither of which I have married yet. I am rereading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_History" target="blank"><u>The Secret History</u></a> out loud to my roommate. 

<br><br>4. Yellow was my favorite color in high school, to such a degree that it became a thing-people-knew-about-me 
and people would send and buy me things in yellow against my will. My friends from high school still bring it up a lot. 
I like yellow a lot, but I think that oversaturated me on it a little.   

<br><br>5.The obvious thing that comes to mind for me is just doing the Public Defenders Office 
stuff and seeing clients in jail through that and (as a part of my job) downloading and printing 
them books and puzzles and stuff to do while incarcerated. Again, definitely a part of the job and 
not like me going out of my way but I could tell it meant a lot to them, especially because during 
COVID there was a lot of solitary confinement and isolation. I am okay at cooking and can enjoy it 
as an activity to do with people or by myself sometimes, but I think hobby would be a strong word. 
Mostly I enjoy eating. 

<br><br>6. I have never played croquet at the beach - that actually sounds kind of difficult, but 
I guess that would dependent on how firmly packed the sand was<sup><a href="#three-one-r-s" id="ref-three-one-r-s">1</a></sup>. 
I know you're asking the questions, but I am curious as to why you don't also play croquet at the beach with your family. 
 

 <br><br>7.  I like New York enough, but the winter is testing me. Mostly, it's nice to be around a 
 lot of my friends and not too far from home. I like Brooklyn more than I like Manhattan though, by 
 a long shot. An emotion I would characterizes how I feel about Brooklyn would be anticipation - it 
 always kind of feels like something is about to happen. 

<br><br>8. I enjoyed it very much, though it was also very stressful in some ways - it remains the 
only job I have ever had where I felt like there were actual stakes if I fucked up. It certainly 
influenced my desire to go back to school for law or social work. I would go as far to say it 
inspired it directly. 
 

<br><br> Hope this helps!

<br><br> Best,

<br><br> Cullen

<div id="three-r" class="footnotes">
    <hr>
        <sup> <a href="#ref-three-one-r-s" id="three-one-r-s">1</a> </sup> Cullen was right. Per 
        <a href="https://backyardsidekick.com/can-you-play-croquet-on-artificial-turf-dirt-or-sand/" target="blank"><u>
        Backyard Sidekick</u></a>: 
        Playing croquet on sand will also have challenges. If the game is played near the edge of the water, where the 
        sand is hard-packed, you might be able to poke traditional wickets into the ground, and the sand will be firm 
        enough to hold them up.

        There may be tracks and obstacles such as seaweed or driftwood. There will probably be some furrows 
        made by waves and wind. Watch out for waves; you might lose your croquet balls in the water.

        <br>Hi Cullen,

<br><br>Grad school is certainly expensive! You seem pretty confident that this was your next step, which 
makes sense as you’ve mentioned that your work at the public defenders office directly influenced you. 
Regardless, I admire determination. Any prospective schools you’re eyeing? 

<br><br>I feel that. I find always myself wanting to talk to someone new after a few minutes of conversation. 
Something about a diverse rotation of people’s thoughts is enticing. What is your go-to conversation starter?

<br><br> A Secret History!!!!! Grand!!!!!!! I actually lent it to one of my dorm mates and he has yet to open it. 
I feel he isn’t aware of the gift I’ve given him.. And what a gift it must to be read A Secret History. So, I just 
read the Natalie Diaz poem, which was gorgeous, sweet, sad, and I felt it fair to send you a poem and as I’m going 
through my saved ones I encounter… A Diaz poem haha. I’ll attach <a href="https://poets.org/poem/these-hands-if-not-gods" 
target="blank"> <u>it</u> </a> and I’ll attach <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/154996/lecture-on-the-history-of-the-house" 
target="blank"> <u>another</u> </a> in the event you’ve read that Diaz poem already. 

<br><br> That’s really incredible! I can’t even imagine the double isolation occurring in that setting and how freaking awful 
it must have felt. On a lighter note, what do you absolutely love to eat?

<br><br> Aha! Tables turned! I’ve never understood what they were doing and consequently what the rules were. And I hate doing 
anything that I feel like I’ll lose at. Competitive, but selectively. I should also mention this is my larger family so like 
cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. and that my family, mom, brother, step-father, didn’t even join them until two New Year Eve’s ago. 
They [larger family] have played ritualistically for years. Since I was like 7.  

<br><br> I’m in Connecticut and truly reeling at how cold it gets! The snow storm nearly took me out! My mom actually just sent 
me some Facebook post entailing a “Winter Warning” from Maine to Texas.. Wishing our blood thins as this apparently makes a 
person feel less cold than those with thicker blood. Science or whatever. Dying for your hot take on Manhattan.. I have to say 
I agree that I don’t adore Manhattan all that much. Though, I’ve only been a few times and only for day trips. Maybe this would 
change with longer stays as I might be a bit too critical of a place I truly know only know on the surface. Brooklyn, I’ve yet 
to explore. You’ll have to give me a list of your favorite places. 

<br><br> What is the worst and best yellow thing you’ve received? My friends aren’t as attentive so I usually buy orange things 
for myself. Right now, the orange things that surround: a mug, my headphones, a fan that plugs into my computer, my Tevas, a 
notebook, my speaker, a water gun, the tea in my mug, etc. A bit obsessed.. 

<br><br> After this email, I believe I’ll have enough content! Thank you so incredibly much for participating! I’m thinking of 
continuing this project so I may, in the future, ask you for the email of someone that you love.

<br><br> Thank you for your time,
<br>Darnell Henderson

    <br>Hi Darnell, 

    <br><br>No worries -
    
    <br<br><br><br>1. It's funny that you say that, because I don't feel very confident about anything I plan on doing! Grad school 
    just seems like a worthwhile thing to work toward as of now, and an option I want to keep open. I think if I went to law school, 
    I would want to go to one of the good southern schools, like UVA or William & Mary or Emory - though I hear Yale has kind of a fun, 
    more creative law school. Honestly, I haven't really gotten that far. If I go to grad school for something else, I would like to go abroad. 
    
    <br><br>2. I don't think I have a go-to conversation starter! I do ask people their favorite book or movie often, but that's more for myself 
    than to start a conversation - 9/10 people say they have no idea and one in a blue moon I get a good recommendation. Sometimes if I can tell 
    someone is super opinionated about media/television stuff I test out my "CW's Riverdale is actually the most interesting and dynamic show on 
    television" thing because it gets a fun subset of people really going. So, actually, now that I read this paragraph back - I guess I usually use media 
    as a conversation starter. I think you can tell a lot about someone by their tastes. 
    
    <br><br>3. I hadn't read it! Thank you. I really, really like the second one you sent. My deepest congratulations to your roommate.  
    
    <br><br>4. My favorite food groups are probably Indian and Italian. I really, really like samosas. I cannot say anything more or more specific 
    because I thought about this question for like five minutes and if I write more I will write a novel. I never really got the appeal of food writing, 
    but now that I'm thinking about it, there sure is a lot to say. I don't like sweets very much, and I don't eat meat, though.
    
    <br><br>5. I think you should try it! 
    
    <br><br>6. There are nice parts of Manhattan, and going during the work day when people aren't out or late at night can be kind of nice, but I had to go 
    to union square on a Saturday to pick up a perfume a few weeks ago and felt the urge very strongly to throw myself into the (ample) traffic. Brooklyn is...more 
    chill, though North Williamsburg can get kind of Manhattan-lite-y. It has good beer, too, if that's your thing. 
    
     <br><br>7. A friend of mine once on purpose picked a banana for me as a snack because of the yellow thing, even though I hate them, when I had asked for an orange. 
     This wasn't a gift, exactly, but I remember being annoyed. A friend from high school got me a very nice yellow sweatshirt from Bar Harbor, Maine, when we were 15 or 16 
     - I still wear it. 
    
    <br><br>I am so, so confused how this could have been helpful in any way for something to do with coding (?) but regardless, it's been a pleasure! I hope your project goes 
    well. Don't hesitate to reach out about anything else and of course, if you are ever in Brooklyn, I would be happy to show you around with my limited familiarity.
    
    <br><br> Godspeed, Good Tidings, etc,
    
    <br><br> Cullen
